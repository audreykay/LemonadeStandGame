Welcome to the Lemonade Stand!

*Life has given you lemons!
*A Mysterious Benefactor has generously donated funds!
*Your #LIFEGOALS are to Get That Cash! ($5,000 to be exact)

To play Lemonade Stand, you will first need to buy stock and make Lemonade.
You will need enough Lemonade to satiate your customers for the ENTIRE day.
An in-game Day Cycle lasts approximately 1 minute.
You will not be able to make Lemonade while you are selling Lemonade.
Any Lemonade left at the end of day will be wasted.
