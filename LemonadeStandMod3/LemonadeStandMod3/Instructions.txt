Welcome to the Lemonade Stand!

*Life has given you lemons!
*Your #LIFEGOALS are to Get That Cash! ($5,000 to be exact)

A mysterious benefactor has generously donated to your Lemonade Stand!

You will need to make Lemonade to sell to your customers.
You can alter the recipe and price of the Lemonade to entice the most customers.
WEATHER will affect how frequently customers arrive.
The TASTE of your Lemonade will affect who likes it enough to buy it.
An in-game DAY lasts approximately 30 seconds.
You cannot make Lemonade, alter the recipe, or buy stock whilst you are running your stand.
You must make enough Lemonade to satiate your customers for the entire day.
Any Lemonade left at the end of the day will be wasted.

Good Luck and Happy Squeezing!
